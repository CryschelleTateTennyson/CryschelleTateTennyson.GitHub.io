#### Dataset Details
The dataset I worked with was provided by the general manager of the Mansfield Megas. It includes statistics from the current NBA season (2024-2025). I found this dataset suitable because it is current and comprehensive, covering various player stats that are vital for making informed decisions about team composition.

#### Analysis Process
To analyze the data, I started by cleaning it. For instance, some players had designations like '2M' or '3M' indicating they played for multiple teams. I decided to keep this information but filtered it out during specific analyses. Using Tableau, I created a storyboard to visualize my findings effectively.

#### Main Takeaways
As I analyzed the data, several key points emerged for the Mansfield Megas. First, focusing on players under 30 seems essential for long-term success. The stats show that teams with younger players have better scoring outputs. Secondly, Nikola Jokic is indeed a player to watch closely. His ability to assist, score, and rebound all at once makes him a triple threat in every matchup. Lastly, with 3-point shooting being so vital in modern basketball, every player needs to be viewed as a potential shooter, regardless of their position.

#### Conclusion and Personal Reflections
This project taught me a lot about the intersection of sports and data analytics. One challenge I faced was deciding what to do with information that is not needed for my current analysis, but may be needed in future analysis. However, I learned how to filter out the data I do not currently need. This experience not only deepened my appreciation for basketball but also solidified my desire to pursue a career in analytics. I am looking forward to my next project from the president.
