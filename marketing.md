I still remember the day I received an unexpected email that changed everything. After weeks of unanswered job applications, I was ready to give up—until a message from the president of The Mega Corporation landed in my inbox. While the job I applied for was already filled, the president presented me with a challenge: capture the attention of recruiters and hiring managers by conducting a data analysis across eight companies within the corporation. The goal? Increase profitability, starting with the marketing campaigns for their on-demand food delivery company, MegaDash.

Excited and determined, I immersed myself in the world of data, eager to uncover insights that could drive real impact.

The president's challenge resonated with my ambition to break into the field of data analytics, and the opportunity to work on actual business data was a dream come true.

While my analysis focuses on MegaDash, the fundamentals can be applied to profitability anywhere. Knowing that my analysis could help a business thrive motivated me every step of the way.

### Dataset Details

The Mega Corporation provided the dataset I used. It is an Excel file containing information about 2,021 unique customers' food delivery purchases over two years. With 36 columns of data, including customer demographics and buying behavior, it was a rich source for uncovering trends and insights. This dataset was perfect for my project as it offered a comprehensive view of customer interactions with the company.

My analysis involved several steps:

1. Data Cleaning: I ensured the data was accurate and complete, removing inconsistencies.
2. Transformation: I organized the data to highlight key metrics and trends.
3. Visualization: I created graphs and charts to better illustrate the data.
4. Statistical Analysis: I looked for correlations, such as the link between income levels and spending.

### Visuals and Insights

Visuals 1 & 2: Customer Acquisition

There has not been a single new customer in over 2,100 days, MegaDash needs to investigate if the marketing strategies are not reaching new audiences or if there are barriers to attracting fresh clientele and run ads accordingly.

This chart shows that customers joining MegaDash in February spend the most on average, emphasizing the potential for marketing during this month. February’s high average spending could be due to several factors, including cold temperatures and inclement weather, post-holiday convenience, Valentine’s Day, and Super Bowl parties. Campaigns centered around each factor could uncover insight used to increase revenue.

Visuals 3 & 4: Customer Spending

Most customers spend between $4 and $418.50, highlighting a significant opportunity to target promotions based on this demographic.

67% of the variance in spending is linked to income levels. The higher their income, the higher MegaDash customers spend, this could be due to the higher incomes having more discretionary money. Income-based promotions could be used to incentivize potential customers.

Visuals 5 & 6: Customer Purchases

My findings revealed that wine had the highest total spent, followed by meat. Targeting fruit, fish, and sweets could increase the total spend on them.

Most purchases are made through the stores suggesting that focusing on store promotions for low-selling products could be a focal point for future campaigns.

Visuals 7 - 10: Customer Demographics

Interestingly, the more kids/teens in a household, the less is spent. MegaDash may become too costly as the number of people it is providing for increases. This provides an opportunity for campaigns that target families with kids and teens.

The following charts show average spending across different categories. While total spent indicates which category contributes the most overall, the focus is on categories with the highest average spent to maximize revenue. Ideally, a Customer Profitability Analysis would assess the revenue each category generates relative to the costs of serving them, but cost data is not provided.

Key insights suggest that customers who are 66 and older, widowed, and/or hold PhDs tend to spend more on average. This information can inform targeted marketing strategies aimed at these demographics.
