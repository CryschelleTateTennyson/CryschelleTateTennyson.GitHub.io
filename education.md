In my journey as a data analyst, I've often found myself looking at numbers and trying to see the stories they tell. Recently, while working on a project analyzing MegaSchools in Massachusetts, I was struck by how data can illuminate education and its impact on students' futures. I remember staring at spreadsheets filled with rows of data, and wondering how these figures translate into real lives and opportunities.

### Why THIS Project?

This project was particularly close to my heart, due to my history working at a middle school. It was part of a challenge presented by the president of The Mega Corporation, where I was tasked with analyzing eight of their companies. Education has always been a topic I feel passionate about, and I wanted to uncover whether these MegaSchools are truly setting their students up for success. 

I was eager to dive into questions like how class sizes impact college admissions, which schools need extra help, and how school districts are performing in crucial subjects like math.

### Dataset Details 

The dataset I used for this project came directly from The Mega Corporation. It was an Excel file that contained information on 1,800 unique schools, with 298 rows detailing various aspects of the students at these schools. The size and scope of the dataset were perfect for exploring my questions, allowing me to analyze trends and draw insights effectively.

### Analysis Process

To begin my analysis, I cleaned and organized the dataset to ensure accuracy. This involved checking for missing data and ensuring consistency across the entries. After that, I used Tableau to visualize the data, which helped me see patterns more clearly.

### Main Takeaways

<img src="images/13.png?raw=true"/>

- The analysis showed that larger class sizes might actually benefit students by exposing them to a wider array of peers and learning styles.
- The statistics reveal that a significant number of schools are not meeting basic graduation standards, which calls for urgent attention and intervention.
- The performance in 4th-grade math across several districts is not up to par, indicating potential weaknesses in early education that could affect students' future learning trajectories.

### Conclusion and Personal Reflections

This project taught me a lot about the power of data in influencing education policies and practices. I faced challenges along the way, particularly in finding the right visualizations to convey my findings effectively. However, the experience has further solidified my interest in data analysis and its implications for improving outcomes.

This concludes my analysis of two of the companies within The Mega Corporation. I am excited to continue the challenge with the next six companies.
