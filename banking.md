In my journey as a data analyst, I've often found myself looking at numbers and trying to see the stories they tell. Recently, while working on a project analyzing MegaSchools in Massachusetts, I was struck by how data can illuminate education and its impact on students' futures. I remember staring at spreadsheets filled with rows of data, and wondering how these figures translate into real lives and opportunities.

### Why THIS Project?

This project was particularly close to my heart, due to my history working at a middle school. It was part of a challenge presented by the president of The Mega Corporation, where I was tasked with analyzing eight of their companies. Education has always been a topic I feel passionate about, and I wanted to uncover whether these MegaSchools are truly setting their students up for success. 

I was eager to dive into questions like how class sizes impact college admissions, which schools need extra help, and how school districts are performing in crucial subjects like math.
