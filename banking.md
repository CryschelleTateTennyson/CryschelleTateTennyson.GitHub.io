When I first started working on this project, I had little idea of how loan dynamics could reflect the economic health of various regions. I remember sitting with piles of data, feeling both excited and overwhelmed. The sheer volume—over a million rows of information—was daunting. Yet, I was driven by a challenge from the president of The Mega Corporation to analyze eight of the corporation’s companies. This project felt particularly interesting, as it involved understanding how much various countries were relying on loans from MegaIDA and whether that reliance was justified or if they were just taking advantage of available funds.

#### Why THIS Project?
The motivation behind this project started as me finishing my challenge for the president, but I developed a genuine interest in understanding the economic relationships between MegaIDA and its member countries. My goal was to find out where the company’s money was going and why. This project sheds light on the numbers and leads to follow-up questions that will determine if MegaIDA is being taken advantage of.

#### What Readers Will Gain

By reading this article, you will gain insights into the borrowing behaviors of regions, the implications of outstanding debts, and the surprising trends in project funding. I’ll share key findings, via SQL syntax, and what they might mean for the future.

#### Key Takeaways
- South Asia has the highest original principal for loans, but Africa has the most loans overall.
- Ukraine currently owes the most, yet it has many loans still being disbursed.
- Education is the main reason for many loans, but it doesn’t incur the highest costs.

#### Dataset Details
The dataset I utilized was provided by The Mega Corporation and includes 1,422,052 rows and 30 columns of loan information. This size allowed for a robust analysis and gave a comprehensive view of the financial landscape across 142 countries. It was vital to work with this dataset because it contained the necessary details to understand borrowing trends.

#### Analysis Process
My analysis involved several steps:
1.	Data Cleaning: I ensured the data were accurate and complete, which included removing duplicate regions and countries. (visuals 1 & 2)
2.	Data Exploration: I explored the data to gain an understanding of it. I called queries that gave me summary information. (visual 3)
3.	Data Analysis: I analyzed the data to answer the intended questions and determine what additional insights I could uncover.

#### Insights
Which region borrows the most money?
Visuals 4 & 5:
While South Asia holds the highest original principal amount at over $20 trillion, Africa leads in the number of loans.
Visuals 6 & 7: 
I also discovered that while South Asia has fewer loans, it has a higher interest rate compared to Africa, which might explain the borrowing patterns.
MegaIDA should further investigate why South Asia has such a high original principal, but Africa has more loans.
Which countries have the most money due to MegaIDA?
Visuals 8 & 9: These images provide an insight into Ukraine’s loan status compared to India and Kenya.
Interestingly, Ukraine has the highest amount due to MegaIDA, but I noticed that most loans from Ukraine are still being disbursed.
Visuals 10 & 11:
While Ukraine may not be a source of concern, India and Kenya should be investigated. India has 46,078 loans that were supposed to be repaid by November of 2024 and Kenya has 16,181 loans that were supposed to be repaid by August of 2024.
Which projects cost the most?
Visuals 12 & 13: 
Furthermore, I was taken aback to find that while education accounted for the most loans, it wasn’t the highest in terms of costs.
Why are SAC II, IN: Elementary Education (SSA II), and BD: Padma Bridge’s original principal amounts so high? Is Education getting enough funding?

#### Main Takeaways
1. **Regional Borrowing Patterns**: South Asia’s high original principal and Africa’s quantity of loans suggest differing financial strategies. It raises questions about loan repayment practices and how these regions manage their debts.
2. **Country Loan Monitoring**: Ukraine’s substantial outstanding amount does not call for attention because their loans are still being disbursed, but the same cannot be said for India and Kenya. especially since most of the loans are still in progress.
3. **Education vs. Costs**: The disparity between education loans and costs prompts further investigation into how funds are distributed across sectors.

#### Conclusion and Personal Reflections
Throughout this project, I faced challenges, especially with data cleaning and ensuring accuracy. However, seeing the final results and the stories they tell about global borrowing practices was rewarding. It reshaped my understanding of how financial relationships work on a global scale and highlighted the importance of responsible lending practices.
